# Stanford Compilers Coursework (CS143)
## Introduction
The result of completing all coursework assignments is a fully-working compiler for the COOL Programming Language.

The compiler compiles COOL into MIPS Assembly. MIPS is a reduced instruction set architecture.

COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language) is a computer programming language designed by Alexander Aiken for use in a compiler course taught at Stanford. COOL resembles many modern programming languages, including features such as objects, automatic memory management, strict static typing and simple reflection. COOL constructs take a few ideas taken from functional programming languages, so that every COOL statement is an expression which must return something.
